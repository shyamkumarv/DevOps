UFS or AUFS(augmented union file system)- combination of image and read/write layer in Docker
docker uses hashing concept-if content is same.. it uses the same image and doesnt create another.
every RUN command creates one image layer-storage space can be reused or write in one statement if not required of creating multiple image layers
